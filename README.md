Facial Recognition In News
==========================

This is quick sketch visualizing the top terms in English-language news reporting on facial recognition 
in various countries. The data was generated from [Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org). It was inspired by
[a student project on social media from the Density Design Lab](https://densitydesign.github.io/teaching-dd15/course-results/es02/group10/).

This is implemented in static HTML with a D3.js visualization.
